Introduction\n\nCareer decisions are messy — too many options, not enough clarity.\n\nWhile going through the Google × Kaggle AI Agents Intensive, I realized that the same multi-agent ideas we practiced can actually be used to solve this problem in real life.\n\nSo I built **AI Opportunity Navigator**, a personalized multi-agent system that looks at a student's or job seeker's background and suggests:\n\n- what roles or opportunities match them  \n- why they match  \n- what steps they should take next  \n\nThe goal is simple: **reduce confusion and give direction.**\n\n---\n\n## 🔹 2. What Problem This Agent Solves\n\nMany people (including me) run into:\n\n- Too many choices and not enough clarity  \n- Not knowing which roles match their skills  \n- Confusion about which professors / labs / competitions fit their interests  \n- Being unsure whether to apply, learn more, or switch direction  \n- Generic career tools that don’t really adapt to their background  \n\nI wanted something that actually **understands your profile and reacts to it**, instead of giving template advice.\n\n---\n\n## 🔹 3. High-Level Idea\n\nThe AI Opportunity Navigator:\n\n- reads a short background from the user  \n- extracts skills, interests, and goals  \n- searches or generates matched opportunities  \n- scores them  \n- creates a simple action plan with “do this next” steps  \n\nUnder the hood, it uses multiple agents working together:\n\n- **Profile Agent** – understands the user  \n- **Opportunity Finder Agent** – proposes possible paths  \n- **Scoring Agent** – ranks options  \n- **Planner Agent** – turns everything into a clear next-step plan  \n- **Orchestrator** – coordinates the workflow\n\nNext, we’ll define the tools and agents.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🔹 4. Agent Architecture (How It Actually Works)\n\nInstead of one giant “do everything” agent, I split the logic into small, focused agents:\n\n1. **Profile Agent**  \n   - Reads the user’s background: education, projects, skills, goals  \n   - Extracts a clean JSON-style profile with:\n     - `skills`\n     - `interests`\n     - `experience`\n     - `goals`\n   - This becomes the shared context for the other agents.\n\n2. **Opportunity Finder Agent**  \n   - Uses the profile to brainstorm possible directions:\n     - roles (e.g., “ML Engineer intern”, “Cloud Support”)\n     - learning paths (courses, topics)\n     - projects or competitions\n   - It doesn’t just throw random ideas — it tries to match skills and interests.\n\n3. **Scoring Agent**  \n   - Looks at each opportunity and scores it on:\n     - skill match (how well it fits the current profile)\n     - difficulty level\n     - relevance to long-term goals  \n   - Returns a short justification for each score.\n\n4. **Planner Agent**  \n   - Takes the top opportunities and converts them into a simple, clear plan:\n     - what to focus on now\n     - what to apply for\n     - what to learn or build next\n   - Output is a human-readable roadmap.\n\n5. **Orchestrator (Multi-Agent Workflow)**  \n   - Controls the overall flow:\n     1. Run **Profile Agent** on the user’s background  \n     2. Pass its output to **Opportunity Finder Agent**  \n     3. Pass opportunities + profile to **Scoring Agent**  \n     4. Pass best options to **Planner Agent**  \n   - Implemented using a **sequential multi-agent workflow**, similar to the course notebooks.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# ===== Cell 1: Imports + auth =====\nimport os\n\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\nfrom google.genai import types\nfrom google.genai.types import Part, UserContent\n\nfrom google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, SequentialAgent\nfrom google.adk.runners import InMemoryRunner\nfrom google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService\nfrom google.adk.tools.function_tool import FunctionTool\n\n# Get GOOGLE_API_KEY from Kaggle secrets\ntry:\n    GOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n    os.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = GOOGLE_API_KEY\n    print(\"✅ Setup and authentication complete.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"❌ ERROR: Add 'GOOGLE_API_KEY' to Kaggle Secrets first.\", e)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-30T02:11:03.813282Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-30T02:11:03.814299Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-30T02:11:03.952383Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-30T02:11:03.814269Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-30T02:11:03.951284Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ Setup and authentication complete.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":62},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# ===== Cell 2: Retry options for the model =====\nretry_config = types.HttpRetryOptions(\n    attempts=5,\n    exp_base=2,\n    initial_delay=1,\n    http_status_codes=[429, 500, 502, 503],\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ Retry config ready.\")\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-30T02:11:05.120620Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-30T02:11:05.121062Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-30T02:11:05.127251Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-30T02:11:05.121031Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-30T02:11:05.126012Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ Retry config ready.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":63},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# ===== Cell 3: Core Python tools =====\n\ndef extract_profile(profile_text: str) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Take a free-form profile text and return a structured profile.\n    Works well with text like:\n    Background: ...\n    Skills: ...\n    Interests: ...\n    Goals: ...\n    \"\"\"\n    lines = profile_text.splitlines()\n    profile = {\n        \"raw_text\": profile_text,\n        \"background\": \"\",\n        \"skills\": [],\n        \"interests\": [],\n        \"goals\": [],\n    }\n\n    current_key = None\n    for line in lines:\n        line = line.strip()\n        lower = line.lower()\n\n        if lower.startswith(\"background:\"):\n            current_key = \"background\"\n            profile[\"background\"] = line.split(\":\", 1)[1].strip()\n        elif lower.startswith(\"skills:\"):\n            current_key = \"skills\"\n            skills_str = line.split(\":\", 1)[1].strip()\n            profile[\"skills\"] = [s.strip() for s in skills_str.split(\",\") if s.strip()]\n        elif lower.startswith(\"interests:\"):\n            current_key = \"interests\"\n            int_str = line.split(\":\", 1)[1].strip()\n            profile[\"interests\"] = [s.strip() for s in int_str.split(\",\") if s.strip()]\n        elif lower.startswith(\"goals:\"):\n            current_key = \"goals\"\n            goals_str = line.split(\":\", 1)[1].strip()\n            profile[\"goals\"] = [s.strip() for s in goals_str.split(\",\") if s.strip()]\n        else:\n            #
